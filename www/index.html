  <p id="p-1">Many high school football players say it�s OK to play with a concussion even though they know they are at risk of serious injury, according to a study presented May 6 at the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) annual meeting in Washington, DC.</p>
  <p id="p-2">The study of 120 high school football players in the Cincinnati area also found that one-quarter had suffered a concussion, and more than half acknowledged they would continue to play with symptoms of a concussion.</p>

            �These attitudes could leave young athletes vulnerable to injury from sports-related concussions,� said study co-author Brit Anderson, M.D., pediatric emergency medicine fellow at Cincinnati Children�s Hospital Medical Center.</p>
  <p id="p-4">Dr. Anderson and her colleagues administered two surveys to the athletes to measure their knowledge of concussions and symptoms as well as their attitudes about playing after a head injury.</p>
  <p id="p-5">Survey results showed that 70% of the players had been educated about concussions, and most could identify common signs and symptoms. Headache was identified as a symptom by 93%, dizziness by 89%, difficulty remembering and sensitivity to light/sound by 78%, difficulty concentrating by 76% and feeling in a fog by 53%.</p>
  <p id="p-6">While 91% recognized a risk of serious injury if they returned to play too quickly, only half would always or sometimes report their concussion symptoms to their coach.</p>
  <p id="p-7">�Despite their knowledge, many athletes in our sample reported that they would not tell their coach about symptoms and would continue to play,� Dr. Anderson said. �A small percentage even responded that athletes have a responsibility to play in important games with a concussion.�</p>
  <p id="p-8">The researchers found no association between a student�s knowledge score and attitude score on the surveys. �In other words, athletes who had more knowledge about concussions were not more likely to report symptoms,� Dr. Anderson said.</p>
  <p id="p-9">�Although further study needs to be done,� she concluded, �it is possible that concussion education alone may not be enough to promote safe concussion behaviors in high school football players.�</p>

  <p id="p-2">
            �As everybody knows, babies are born and cleaned up and then put in a nice, tight swaddle to keep them comfortable and warm,� said Dr. Glassy, chair of the AAP Section on Early Education and Child Care Executive Committee. �They love it. You can see it on their faces. The problem comes when we don�t have a clear idea of when to tell parents to end it.�</p>

    <h2>Some child care centers ban swaddling</h2>
    <p id="p-4">Swaddling has become the subject of controversy.</p>
    <p id="p-5">In 2011, the National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care and Early Education recommended against swaddling, saying it could increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Then, Minnesota banned the practice in child care centers, while other states have addressed swaddling in their child care licensing standards. For instance, a preschool in Liverpool, Pa., was shut down in March for several violations, including improperly restraining infants by wrapping a blanket tightly around them.</p>
    <p id="p-6">The National Resource Center also objects to swaddling because it can cause hip problems.</p>
    <p id="p-7">
            Working on a Navajo reservation, Richard Schwend, M.D., FAAP, saw a lot of hip dysplasia among babies carried around in tight swaddling. Modern swaddling calls for freedom of the legs and hips, said Dr. Schwend, chair of the AAP Section on Orthopaedics Executive Committee.</p>
    <div id="F2" class="fig pos-anchor  even">
      <div class="fig-inline">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p id="p-9">�With modern swaddling, the theory is that kids have startle reflexes that they don�t have control over,� he said. �If you can secure their arms, they have the benefits of swaddling without the risk to the hips.�</p>
    <p id="p-10">The blanket also needs to be loose enough that a hand can fit between the blanket and the baby�s chest so the baby doesn�t have trouble breathing. But the blanket can�t be so loose that it unravels.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="sec-2">
    <h2>Mixed messages</h2>
    <p id="p-11">Because data about the benefits and safety of swaddling conflict, the Academy has not taken an official stance on the practice, said Rachel Y. Moon, M.D., FAAP, lead author of the AAP safe sleep guidelines and chair of the Task Force on SIDS. But, Dr. Moon said, babies should not be swaddled past 2 months of age.</p>
    <p id="p-12">
            �Given that we see deaths from babies who are swaddled and end up on their stomachs by 2-2� months, I get really nervous when babies are swaddled past the age of 8 weeks,� Dr. Moon said.</p>
    <div id="F3" class="fig pos-anchor  odd">
      <div class="fig-inline">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p id="p-14">Because child care centers typically take infants when they are about 2 or 3 months old, child care providers should not be swaddling babies, Dr. Moon said.</p>
    <p id="p-15">Those recommendations are at odds with what Harvey Karp, M.D., FAAP, endorses in his book, <em>The Happiest Baby on the Block</em>. He has been an outspoken advocate for safe swaddling as he touts the five S�s � swaddling, side/stomach position (The AAP and others recommend babies always be placed on their backs to sleep), swinging, shushing and sucking � for calming fussy babies.</p>
    <p id="p-16">
            �If we can reduce crying and increase sleep, that is a good thing,� he said.</p>

    <p id="p-18">Dr. Karp also says child care centers should be allowed to swaddle babies with proper instruction. �It�s a misguided policy,� he said, adding parents who want their babies swaddled shouldn�t be undermined.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="sec-3">
    <h2>Discuss safe swaddling with parents</h2>
    <p id="p-19">Parents should learn about safe swaddling when pediatricians first unwrap their newborns in the hospital, Dr. Moon said.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="graphic" id="graphic-5">
      <div class="graphic-inline float">

      </div>
      <div class="graphic-caption">
        <p id="p-21" class="first-child">When talking with parents about safe swaddling, pediatricians should instruct them to keep blankets loose around the hips and to stop swaddling babies when they reach 2 months of age.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p id="p-22">Swaddling also should come up at well visits as part of a conversation about healthy sleep habits such as always putting babies to sleep on their backs. Swaddling can be brought up as a safety issue, just as a doctor would bring up the danger of leaving a baby unattended on a changing table, Dr. Glassy said.</p>
    <p id="p-23">�Two months is an important touchstone to talk about sleeping,� she said. By then, parents who are going back to work are making child care arrangements and at the same time, their babies are beginning to move around more.</p>
    <p id="p-24">
            Jennifer Shu, M.D., FAAP, medical editor of the AAP Healthy Children website, agrees that parents should be encouraged to use safe techniques if they choose to swaddle their babies. They also should stop swaddling when the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits.</p>

    <p id="p-26">Parents will be looking for alternative ways to help babies sleep, and a wearable sleep blanket may be one option, added Dr. Shu, author of the book, <em>Heading Home with Your Newborn: From Birth to Reality</em>.</p>
    <p id="p-27">�If parents understand the reasoning behind limiting swaddling to younger ages,� Dr. Shu said, �they will be more likely to follow the recommendation.�</p>

    <h2>Thomas W. Tryon, M.D., FAAP, Kansas City, Mo.</h2>
    <p id="p-4">
            One of the most exciting yet challenging aspects of practicing pediatrics today is the rapid change in our specialty and in the world of medicine. While the Affordable Care Act, accountable care organizations and other changes within medicine will no doubt impact each of our professional lives, much about our hallowed profession will stay the same.</p>
    <div id="F1" class="fig pos-anchor  odd">

    </div>
    <p id="p-6">As your president, I would focus on three major priorities for the AAP: 1) maintaining and strengthening the practice of pediatrics; 2) a renewed focus on strengthening and building our membership; and 3) an innovative focus on global health care initiatives.</p>
    <p id="p-7">In Dr. John Lovett Morse�s AAP presidential address in 1931 he stated, �The objects of the American Academy of Pediatrics, as I see them, are primarily altruistic. They are, in brief, to improve the health and welfare of our children, to raise the standards of pediatric education and practice, and to encourage research in pediatrics.� Over 80 years later, I believe our mission is still the same and our focus has not changed.</p>
    <p id="p-8">Second, the AAP will need a continued focus on strengthening and building our membership. We are a grassroots membership organization that is in a state of change. With the talented colleagues serving with me on the Committee on Membership, we have been dedicated to creating a brand for the AAP, increasing membership value, engaging young and diverse physicians, and enhancing relationships between national AAP and state chapters. I will work to see those efforts continue.</p>
    <p id="p-9">Finally, I believe we need an innovative and enhanced focus on global health care initiatives. Through sharing our respected intellectual property such as the <em>Red Book</em> and <em>Pediatric Nutrition Handbook</em>, we can directly impact disease and death in children in emerging countries from malnutrition and preventable or treatable infections. I believe we have a moral imperative to find innovative ways to get this life-saving information into the hands of our pediatrician colleagues around the world.</p>
    <p id="p-10">While our challenges are great and our world is ever-changing, I believe our future is bright. Together with you, with confidence, I look forward to facing that future.</p>

    <h2>Sandra G. Hassink, M.D., FAAP, Wilmington, Del.</h2>
    <p id="p-11">
            I believe the highest priority for the AAP is to energize our profession and engage the public and our partners in creating a National Agenda for Children. When I attended my first AAP chapter meeting as a young physician just out of residency, I came home feeling energized by the pediatricians I met and excited about what we could do for kids. I have felt that way at every AAP meeting ever since.</p>

    </div>
    <p id="p-13">What was it that made me come back time after time to engage with my fellow members? What is it that makes our members so special? I have come to realize that on a daily basis pediatricians are translating experiences with patients and families directly into advocacy and action. We are using our experience and expertise to inform clinical care, policy, education and advocacy in our practices, communities, at the state and federal level to advance pediatrics and benefit children. This is our greatest treasure and because of this, the AAP must focus on supporting the practice of pediatrics, encouraging professional development and increasing the engagement of the nation�s pediatricians in advocacy.</p>
    <p id="p-14">To support practice, the AAP must understand and influence the evolving models of health care and support the roles of primary care and employed pediatricians, pediatric medical and surgical subspecialists, and make sure that pediatrics remains a coveted and viable career choice for medical students and residents. The AAP must work to increase connections between pediatricians in practice to public health, research and administration, increasing our ability to work along the entire continuum of pediatrics.</p>
    <p id="p-15">We must encourage professional development by promoting leadership training, quality improvement, use of electronic medical records and electronic communications, and fostering the skills our members need to facilitate intraprofessional teams and community collaborations. We must help pediatricians engage parents in ways that inform practice and enhance communication. We must educate and mentor members in advocacy as never before. We must do this because now is the time to take our Agenda for Children � our vision for children � and turn it outward to take the lead in creating a National Agenda for Children.</p>
